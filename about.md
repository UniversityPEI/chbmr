# About Us

The Centre for Health and Community Research (CHCR) is a collaborative research group based in the University of Prince Edward Island. The CHCR specializes in innovative research which supports the healthcare and biotech industries throughout Prince Edward Island, and the rest of Canada. One of the most unique ways that it does this is by including patient-oriented research designs. 

The CHCR is interested in advancing research in areas that are pressing and relevant to the health and biotech industries, and aims to regularly develop new projects and collaborations to accomplish this goal. The CHCR is dedicated to developing and promoting original research, as well as collaborating with individuals and groups to develop new projects and advance ongoing ones within the Health and Biotech Industries. We are always searching for key areas both in PEI and throughout Canada that demonstrate a need for research and innovative options. 

## Examples of Current Projects

Currently, there are a variety of ongoing projects within the areas of mental health and addictions, high-resource patients, data analysis, knowledge translation, and cluster research. The projects that are conducted by the CHCR use a variety of research methodologies, including mixed methods, quantitative, and qualitative practices.

#### CBT4CBT

The CHCR is conducting pilot trials of the first online computer program that teaches cognitive behavioural therapy for addictions in Canada. Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT) was created by our collaborator Dr. Kathleen Carroll from the Yale School of Medicine, and offers cognitive behavioural therapy for drug and alcohol abuse via an online platform. CBT4CBT demonstrated excellent results in the United States and the CHCR is currently running trials in remote, rural, and First Nation populations in PEI before expanding the program throughout Canada.

It is expected that in the upcoming year (2018/2019), the CHCR will use qualitative methods to include citizens from PEI in determining the best way to create a CBT4CBT program that is specifically designed for youth (13-18 years of age). 

#### SARV

The CHCR completed its preliminary Small Area Rate Variation (SARV) analysis, which examined the drivers of high-cost healthcare usage in PEI. This research (Phase 1) led to the following findings:

* Almost 75% of healthcare costs originate from 5% of the population
* Chronic conditions are significantly more prevalent int he top 5% of healthcare users
* There is a higher concentration of high cost users among areas with poorer status, with respect to the social determinants of health

Recently (2018), as a follow up to the Phase 1 study, interviews were conducted with patients, caregivers and healthcare providers to discuss the current healthcare system in PEI, and to learn more about what might be leading to the findings found in Phase 1. 

#### SIDR

Under the MSSU and SPOR PEI, the Centre is conducting evidence-based research by increasing the use of routinely collected administrative health data, as well as patient and treatment registries. Relatedly, the CHCR is also expanding and enhancing the Data Repositories that will link existing administrative health databases with patient and treatment registries by developing a Secure Island Data Repository (SIDR). 

#### Gambling

Under the PEI Department of Health, the Centre is in the beginning stages of research on Gambling Prevalence on Prince Edward Island.
