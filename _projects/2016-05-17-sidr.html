<h1></h1>
<h1>Secure Island Data Repository</h1>
<p>The Secure Island Data Repository is one of the initiatives created by the MSSU that is being overseen by the CHCR. Over the past few years the CHCR has been developing a secure repository on the UPEI campus to store unidentifiable health data in order to aid researchers while also protecting confidential health information.</p>
<p> Data Harmonization combines information from different sources and assembles them to provide users with a unified view of these data sets. This allows for a timely and accurate extraction of information. While creating the Secure Island Data Repository, the CHCR is also working to begin linking Data Repositories for existing administrative health databases with patient and treatment registries. This will transform them into accessible and more user friendly sources for research evaluation across the continuum of health care. Through this process, we are also creating standardized analytic data sets and protocols for utilizing data to facilitate collaboration.</p>
<p> The Secure Island Data Repository is located in the UPEI School of Business and overseen by a Data Analyst employed by the CHCR. The CHCR is developing data sharing agreements to improve the efficiency of analyzing data for research while protecting privacy and security.</p>
