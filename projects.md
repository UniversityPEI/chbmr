# Research Services

The CHCR provides health and biotech research services for organizations and government bodies. Our effective team ensures the most valuable method(s) of conducting research and utilizing resources are employed, making certain results offer meaningful and significant support.

# Knowledge Translation

Knowledge translation is a key priority, and the CHCR works to connect with knowledge users and stakeholders, and has organized presentations, networking events, workshops and panels to disseminate research findings in order to support informed decision-making.

# Education & Training

In collaboration with the [University of Prince Edward Island MBA](http://business.upei.ca/mba) program, we assist graduate students in carrying out scholarly research, contributing to the training of the future business leaders in biotechnology management. Through signature projects, students will expand their knowledge of research & development, commercialization, ethical, and regulatory topics, which emphasize evidence-based research and applied learning.

In addition, the Centre supports undergraduate students who wish to learn more about biotechnology management through the engagement of an undergraduate biotechnology course, research projects and employment. Contact us for more information.
