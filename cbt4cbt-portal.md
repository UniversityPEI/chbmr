  **Consent Form**

  **Computer-Assisted Delivery of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Mental Health and Addictions – an Implementation Trial**

  **Introduction**

  You are invited to join a research study. This study will test the feasibility of offering a computer based therapy for substance abuse in PEI. **C**omputer-**B**ased **T**raining for **C**ognitive **B**ehavioral **T**herapy is a web-based program that teaches a variety of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy skills that are specific for helping people to reduce substance abuse. These include:

  * Understanding patterns of substance use
  * Learning to recognize and deal with cravings
  * Addressing thoughts about substance use that can set you up to use
  * How to effectively say ‘No’ to offers of alcohol or drugs
  * How to be more aware of patterns of thinking and decision making that can lead to drug use

  The CBT4CBT program is made up of short videos, interactive forms, and tutorials that teach decision making and coping skills to help overcome addictions. It was developed in the United States by Dr. Kathleen Carroll of the Yale School of Medicine, and it has already been shown to benefit those who have used it. Drs. Juergen Krause and Michelle Patterson have brought CBT4CBT to Canada for the first time to see if adding this therapy option to the current addiction treatment programs offered on PEI will help its individuals better manage their substance use.

  The information collected during the study will be used to test if CBT4CBT is a feasible therapy to offer on PEI in this manner. The hope is that the ideal method(s) for providing access to the CBT4CBT program will be identified through this project and thus we could best implement CBT4CBT on PEI and across Canada.

  **Why Am I Being Asked to Join this Study?**

  You were identified by a healthcare provider or have self-identified as someone over the age of 18 who may benefit from CBT4CBT and expressed an interest in obtaining access to the program. You may take part in this study if you are or ever have been struggling with substance abuse, but NOT if you are feeling like you may do harm to yourself or to others, or require immediate hospitalization. You may choose to discuss in more detail with your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

  If you decide to take part in this research, you can stop at any time simply by not logging into the CBT4CBT program. There are no repercussions if you do decide to stop using the program and your use of the program will not affect your access to other treatments in any way. People who have used the CBT4CBT program before you have not had any negative effects and the studies have not shown any risk to users, but you may choose to stop using the CBT4CBT program at any point if you feel your health situation has changed. All data collected up to the date you stop using the program will remain in the study records, to be included in study related analyses.

  **What Happens in this Study?**

  Your pharmacist will give you a login sheet which provides you with a unique username and password.

You can access the program on a laptop, computer, tablet or phone as long as it has access to the internet. You may use the CBT4CBT program as much or as little as you like. You will have access to the program for one year from the day that you first login. The login sheet also tells you the website you can visit if you have any questions about the CBT4CBT program. If you have a medical emergency or medical-related question, please call the provincial numbers listed on the login sheet.

  **Will it Cost Me Anything?**

  It will cost you nothing to be in this study. Access to the CBT4CBT program is provided free of charge.
