<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>
<p>The UPEI Centre for Health and Biotech Management Research is a collaborative research group based with the School of Business at the University of Prince Edward Island that specializes in supporting the Canadian health and biotechnology sectors through three pillars: research, knowledge translation, and education and training.</p>
<p><strong>Three Pillars</strong></p>
<p><u>Health Services Research</u></p><p>
</p><ul><li>The CHBMR is collaborating with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on a Strategy for a Patient Orientated Research (SPOR) forming a new unit called the Maritime SPOR Support Unit (MSSU). The MSSU aligns with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">Canadian Institutes of Health Researchâ€™s</a> (CIHR) strategic goal to translate research results into improved health outcomes for Canadians.</li><li>The MSSU will&nbsp;provide the model for evaluating health programs using&nbsp;evidence-based practice, an interdisciplinary approach in which all&nbsp;practical decisions made should 1) be based on research studies and 2) that these research studies are selected and interpreted according to some specific norms characteristic.</li><li>Research agendas will be matched with policy questions to make sure relevant questions are studied. &nbsp;The MSSU will conduct evidence-based research by increasing the use of routinely collected administrative health data, patient and treatment registries and enhancing and expanding the Data Repositories that will link existing administrative health databases with patient and treatment registries. This will transform them into accessible and more user friendly sources for research evaluation across the health care continuum.</li></ul><p>
</p><p><u>Knowledge Translation</u></p><ul><li>Knowledge translation is a key priority, and the CHBMR systematically designs implementation strategies at multiple levels to effectively apply research findings to improve the lives of Canadians.</li><li>We work to connect with knowledge users and stakeholders, and also organize presentations, networking events, workshops and panels to discuss disseminate research findings in order to support informed decision-making.</li></ul><p><u>Education & Training</u></p><ul><li>We use an integrated training program that trains and educates students to fill research needs across the Maritimes. This training program will also match suitable candidates with opportunities in core areas.</li></ul>
