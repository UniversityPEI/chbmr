Hailey Arsenault joined the CHCR in March 2018 as a Researcher (Graduate Student).  Currently, Hailey is working on several projects for the Center: most notably, she has played a large role in our SARV (qualitative) project. 

Hailey has received an Addictions Careworker Diploma (McMaster University), her BA in Psychology (Saint Francis Xavier University), and is about to complete her Masters degree in Applied Health Services Research (University of Prince Edward Island). She hopes to continue her studies at the doctorate level within the next year. 

Prior to joining our team, Hailey was working as a Policy Analyst (Seniors Health) with the PEI Department of Health and Wellness. She has also held various other positions within multiple academic and government settings. These experiences have led to Hailey's passion for continuing to work in Prince Edward Island, specifically in roles which can better the healthcare system, and the experience of patients, providers, and caregivers. 

When Hailey isn't at the Centre or doing other work, she enjoys: petting any dog possible (specifically her own golden retriever, Maizey), napping, and spending time with friends and family.
